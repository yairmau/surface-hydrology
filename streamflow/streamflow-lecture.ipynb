    "Watershed Size: Larger watersheds have larger T*, other things equal. Analyses of large floods by Holtan and Overton (1963) indicated that T* is strongly related to drainage area; however, the re- lationship varies from region to region, presum- ably largely because of differences in watershed geology, soils, and topography.\n",
    "Soils and Geology: Water moves fastest toward streams as overland flow and slowest as subsurface flow (as discussed more fully later in this chapter). Thus watersheds with low surface hydraulic con- ductivities (e.g., clay soils), where less infiltration and more overland flow occur, should have smaller T* than those with higher conductivities (e.g., sandy soils). If flow paths are predominantly in the subsurface, watersheds with higher hydrau- lic conductivities will have smaller values of T*.\n",
    "Slope: Steeper slopes should be associated with faster surface and subsurface water movement and hence smaller T*.\n",
    "Land Use: In general, watersheds with heavy vege- tation, especially forests, have permeable surface soils that allow rapid infiltration and subsurface flow to streams, resulting in larger T*. In contrast, sparsely vegetated watersheds tend to have lower T* because their lower surface permeability makes\n",

    "overland flow more common. Watersheds with in- tensive urbanization (more impermeable areas and storm sewers) generally have faster water move- ment and smaller T*.\n",
    "Watershed Wetness: As seen in section 10.2.3.2, the wetness of the watershed at the time of a rainfall event (antecedent condition) usually has a significant influence on the connectivity of surface and subsur- face flow paths and the extent of the contributing area, so that a given watershed will have a smaller T* when wet than when drier. The physical relations underlying this are discussed in section 10.4.\n",
    "In the linear-watershed model the centroid lag, TLC, is equal to T*, regardless of the timing of inputs. Thus if the timing and amounts of effective water in- put and output can be determined, average TLC would appear to be the best estimate of the charac- teristic response time for a given watershed.\n",
