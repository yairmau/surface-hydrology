The station WBAN number. The UTC date of the observation. The UTC time at the end of the 5-minute observation period. For example, 0420 designates the observational period starting just after 0415 and ending at 0420; and 0000 designates the last 5-minute period of the previous day. The Local Standard Time (LST) date of the observation. The Local Standard Time (LST) time at the end of the 5-minute period (see UTC_TIME description). The version number of the station datalogger program that was in effect at the time of the observation. Note: This field should be treated as text (i.e. string). Station longitude, using WGS-84. Station latitude, using WGS-84. Average temperature, in degrees C. See Notes F and G. Total amount of precipitation, in mm. See Notes F and H. Average global solar radiation received, in watts/meter^2. QC flag for the average global solar radiation measurement. See Note I. Average infrared surface temperature, in degrees C. See Note J. The type of infrared surface temperature measurement: 'R' denotes raw (uncorrected); 'C' denotes corrected; and 'U' is shown if the type is unknown/missing. See Note J. QC flag for the surface temperature measurement. See Note I. Relative humidity average, as a percentage. See Note K. QC flag for the relative humidity measurement. See Note I. Average soil moisture (volumetric water content in m^3/m^3) at 5 cm below the surface. See Note M. Average soil temperature at 5 cm below the surface, in degrees C. See Note M. The presence or absence of moisture due to precipitation, in Ohms. High values (>= 1000) indicate an absence of moisture.  Low values (< 1000) indicate the presence of moisture. QC flag for the wetness measurement. See Note I. Average wind speed, in meters per second, at a height of 1.5 meters. QC flag for the wind speed measurement. See Note I.
