A water-input event begins at time $t=0$ and ends at $t=T_w$.\n* The **infiltration rate**, $f(t)$ [L T$^{-1}$], is the rate at which water enters the soil from the surface.\n* The **infiltrability**, also called **infiltration capacity**, $f^*(t)$ [L T$^{-1}$], is the maximum rate at which infiltration could occur at any time; note that this changes during the infiltration event.\n* The **depth of ponding**, $H(t)$ [L], is the depth of water standing on the surface.\n\nSource: @ward2003environmental, page 63, 64\n\nInfiltration capacity of absorbent paper is low, there is much runoff\n![](/archive/figures/ward_and_trimble_infiltration_capacity1.png)\n\nInfiltration capacity of sponge is high, there is little runoff\n![](/archive/figures/ward_and_trimble_infiltration_capacity2.png)\n\nInfiltration capacity of the sponge is limited by the overlying layer with low permeability\n![](/archive/figures/ward_and_trimble_infiltration_capacity3.png)\n\nInfiltration capacity of the sponge is limited by the underlying layer\n![](/archive/figures/ward_and_trimble_infiltration_capacity4.png)\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/ego2FkuQwxc >}}\n\n\n\n\n![@ward2003environmental, page 65\n](/archive/figures/ward-and-trimble-figure3.17-page65.png)\n\n## Darcy\n\nDarcy's equation for vertical flow\n$$\nq = -K \\frac{\\partial H_\\text{total}}{\\partial z}\n$$\n\nwhere the total head $H_\\text{total}=-H_\\text{suction}-z_\\text{depth}$, and\n\n* $H_\\text{suction}$ is the suction head (negative pressure head)\n* $z_\\text{depth}$ is the depth, points *downward*.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n$$\nq = K \\frac{\\partial H_\\text{suction}}{\\partial z} + K\n$$\n\nSubstituting the above into the continuity equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial z}\n$$\n\nyields the Richards equation.\n\n## Richards\n\nRichards equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n\\left[\nK(\\theta)\n\\frac{\\partial H_\\text{total}}{\\partial z}\n\\right]\n$$\n\nSubstituting $H_\\text{total}=-H_\\text{suction}-z_\\text{depth}$ yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n\\left[\nK(\\theta)\n\\left(\n\\frac{\\partial(-H_\\text{suction} - z)}{\\partial z}\n\\right)\n\\right]\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} =\n-\n\\underbrace{\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n\\left(\nK(\\theta)\n\\frac{\\partial H_\\text{suction}}{\\partial z}\n\\right)\n}\n_{\\text{matric}}\n-\n\\underbrace{\n\\frac{\\partial K(\\theta)}{\\partial z}\n}\n_{\\text{gravitational}}\n$$\n\n### short times\n\nAs the water starts to enter the relatively dry soil, the pressure differences in the water at the surface and in the soil are quite large and, as a result, the second term on the right is practically negligible compared to the first one.\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} =\n-\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n\\left(\nK(\\theta)\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial z}\n\\right)\n$$\n\n### long times\n\nAs illustrated in the figure below (Davidson et al., 1963), after longer times of infiltration, the water content profile near the surface gradually becomes more uniform and it eventually assumes the satiation value, or $\\theta\\rightarrow \\theta_0$; similarly, the pressure in the upper layers of the soil becomes gradually atmospheric, or $H \\rightarrow 0$. Hence, their vertical gradients\n<!-- ∂ θ /∂ z and ∂ H /∂ z both approach -->\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial z} \\text{ and } \\frac{\\partial H_\\text{suction}}{\\partial z} \\longrightarrow 0\n$$\n\nFrom Darcy's equation we have that\n\n$$\nq = K(\\theta_0) = K_\\text{sat}\n$$\n\n![](/archive/figures/davidson-1963-figure19.png)\n\n### Rainfall infiltration\n\nInfiltration rate is equal to rainfal rate, at least at first.\nIf rainfall rate $w$ is lower than $K_\\text{sat}$, than everything enters the soil, i.e., $f=K_\\text{sat}$.\nHowever, if $w>K_\\text{sat}$, water content $\\theta$ will increase at the surface, until it reaches $\\theta_0$, and at that moment, called ponding time $t_p$,  water will begin to accumulate at the surface.\n\n@hillel2003introduction, figure 12.1\n![](/archive/figures/hillel_introduction_soil_physics_figure12.1.png)\n\n@hillel2003introduction, figure 12.2\n![](/archive/figures/hillel_introduction_soil_physics_figure12.2.png)\n\n## Horton equation\n\nOne of the most widely used models, developed by R.E.

Water penetrates a dry soil with a certain initial moisture content, and wets the layer to a saturated moisture content as it traverses deeper. The connection between soil moisture and infiltration rate is modeled in the Green-Ampt equation:\n\n$$\nf(t) = K_\\text{sat}\n\\left[\n1 + \\frac{|\\psi_f|\\cdot \\left( \\phi - \\theta_0 \\right)}{F(t)}\n\\right]\n$$\n\n* $f(t)$: infiltration rate\n* $F(t)$: cumulative infiltration rate, $F=\\int\\! f \\text{ d}t$\n* $\\psi_f$: effective wetting-front suction\n* $\\phi$: soil porosity\n* $\\theta_0$:  initial soil water content\n\nThe same equation can be simply be rewritten as\n\n$$f = \\frac{A}{F} + B$$\n\nwhere\n\n* $A = K_\\text{sat}\\cdot|\\psi_f|\\cdot \\left( \\phi - \\theta_0 \\right)$\n* $B= K_\\text{sat}$\n\nThe porosity $\\phi$ and the saturated hydraulic conductivity $K_\\text{sat}$ can be estimated from the soil texture. The wetting-front suction $\\psi_f$ can be estimated using the Brooks-Corey parameters:\n<!-- Dingman, page 371 -->\n\n$$\n|\\psi_f| = \\frac{2b+3}{2b+6}\\cdot |\\psi_{ae}|,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi_{ae}$ is the air-entry pressure head.\nValues for the parameters above can be found in this table:\n\n![](/archive/figures/dingman_table7.4.png)\n\n## Best Fit, Least Squares Method\n\n![](https://yairmau.com/tutorials/python/least-squares.png)\n\n",
