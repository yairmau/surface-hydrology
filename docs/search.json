    "text": "Syllabus\n\nCourse description\nThis is an introductory course in Surface Hydrology, dealing with some of the major processes in the hydrologic cycle: precipitation, evaporation and transpiration, infiltration, runoff generation and streamflow. The different topics will be treated using mathematical models and practical programming exercises.\n\n\nCourse aims\nThe course aims at giving the students a quantitative understanding of the main processes in the hydrologic cycle. We will characterize the hydrologic cycle and its fluxes through mass balance equations. The random nature of the various processes will be studied with statistics, time series analysis, return periods, extreme value distributions, etc. We will take a “hands-on approach”, where students will actively engage with the material by analysing data and writing models using Python.\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nOn successful completion of this module, students should be able to:\n\nIdentify the various components of hydrologic budget and their interdependency.\nDescribe the various processes in hydrology (precipitation, infiltration, evaporation, etc) in a mathematical language.\nWrite computer code to analyze the statistics of hydrologic fluxes, and construct models of hydrological systems.\n\n\n\nBooks and other sources\n\nDingman, S.

A final and larger project (50% of the grade) will be due at the end of the semester. All projects will be done in Python (on Jupyter Notebooks).",

    "text": "1.5 Energy drives the hydrologic cycle\nFrom Margulis (2019)\n\nA key aspect of the hydrologic cycle is the fact that it is driven by energy inputs (primarily from the sun). At the global scale, the system is essentially closed with respect to water; negligible water is entering or leaving the system. In other words, there is no external forcing in terms of a water flux. Systems with no external forcing will generally eventually come to an equilibrium state. So what makes the hydrologic cycle so dynamic? The solar radiative energy input, which is external to the system, drives the hydrologic cycle. Averaged over the globe, 342 W m^{-2} of solar radiative energy is being continuously input to the system at the top of the atmosphere. This energy input must be dissipated, and this is done, to a large extent, via the hydrologic cycle. Due to this fact, the study of hydrology is not isolated to the study of water storage and movement, but also must often include study of energy storage and movements.",

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — NOAA:\n\nNormals serve two purposes: a reference period for monitoring current weather and climate, and a good description of the expected climate at a location over the seasons. They provide a basis for determining whether today’s weather is warmer or colder, wetter or drier. They also can be used to plan for conditions beyond the time span of reliable weather forecasts. A 30-year time period was chosen by the governing body of international meteorology in the 1930s, so the first normals were for 1901-1930, the longest period for which most countries had reliable climate records. International normals were called for in 1931-1960 and 1961-1990, but many countries updated normals more frequently, every 10 years, so as to keep them up to date. In 2015 this was made the WMO standard, so all countries will be creating normals for 1991-2020.",

    "text": "7.5 Return Period\nWe will follow Brutsaert (2005), page 513.\nWe call F(x) the CDF of the PDF f(x). F(x) indicates the non-exceedance probability, i.e., the probability that a certain event above x has not occurred (or that an event below x has occurred, same thing). The execeedance probability, also called survival probability, equals 1-F(x), and is the probability that a certain event above x has occurred. It’s reciprocal is the return period:\n\nT_r(x) = \\frac{1}{1-F(x)}\n\nThis return period is the expected number of observations required until x is exceeded once. In our case, we can ask the question: how many years will pass (on average) until we see a rainfall event greater that that of 26 August 1983?\nLet’s call p=F(x) the probability that we measured once and that an event greater than x has not occurred. What is the probability that a rainfall above x will occur only on year number k?\n\nit hasn’t occurred on year 1 (probability p)\nit hasn’t occurred on year 2 (probability p)\nit hasn’t occurred on year 3 (probability p)\n…\nit has occurred on year k (probability 1-p)\n\nP\\{k \\text{ trials until }X&gt;x\\} = p^{k-1}(1-p)\nEvery time the number k will be different. What will be k on average?\n\n\\bar{k} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k P(k) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k p^{k-1}(1-p)\n\nLet’s open that up:\n\n\\begin{split}\n\\bar{k} &= 1-p + 2p(1-p) + 3p^2(1-p) + 4p^3(1-p)+ \\cdots\\\\\n\\bar{k} &= 1-p + 2p - 2p^2 + 3p^2 - 3p^4 + 4p^3 - 4p^4+ \\cdots \\\\\n\\bar{k} &= 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4 + \\cdots\n\\end{split}\n\nFor p&lt;1, the series converges to \n1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4 + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{1-p},\n therefore \n\\bar{k} = \\frac{1}{1-p}.\n\nWe conclude that if we know the exceedance probability, we immediately can say what the return times are. We now need a way of estimating this exceedance probability.",

This method ensures a more even distribution of plotting positions, correcting the bias that often occurs with small sample sizes when using n alone. By dividing by n+1, each rank’s cumulative probability is slightly adjusted, resulting in more realistic and representative plotting positions. This adjustment is particularly important in hydrology and meteorology, where accurate representation of extreme precipitation events is essential for risk assessment and infrastructure planning. The Weibull plotting position thus provides a more reliable tool for understanding and predicting extreme weather patterns.\nNow we just need to flip the vertical and horizontal axes, and we’re done! We have our cdf!\n\n\ncdf as we are use to\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))\nax.plot(max_annual['PRCP'], cdf_fromdata, 'o')\nax.set(xlabel=\"annual daily precipitation max (mm)\",\n       ylabel=f\"cdf\",\n       xlim=[0, 270],\n       ylim=[0, 1]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the cumulative distribution from before, based on the histogram.\n\n\ncdf as we are use to\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))\nax.plot(max_annual['PRCP'], cdf_fromdata, 'o', label=\"exact cdf from data\")\nax.hist(h, bins=bins, cumulative=1, density=True, histtype=\"bar\", color=\"lightgray\", label=\"cdf from histogram\")\nax.legend(loc=\"lower right\")\nax.set(xlabel=\"annual daily precipitation max (mm)\",\n       ylabel=f\"cdf\",\n       xlim=[0, 270],\n       ylim=[0, 1]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest data point in this graph goes only to 252 mm, corresponding to the highest event recorded in 74 years. We can use the GEV cdf to calculate return times for any desired levels, simply by converting the vertical axis (cdf) to return period, using the equation we found earlier. \nT_r(x) = \\frac{1}{1-F(x)},\n\nwhere T_r is the return period (in years), and F is the cdf.\n\n\ncdf as we are use to\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))\n\nT = 1 / (1-cdf_fromdata)\nax.plot(T, max_annual['PRCP'], 'o', label=\"return time from data\")\n\nax.plot(1/(1-cdf(rain)), rain, color='tab:orange', lw=2, label=\"return time from gev\")\nax.legend(loc=\"upper right\", frameon=False)\nax.set(xlabel=\"return time (year)\",\n       ylabel=f\"annual daily precipitation max (mm)\",\n       xlim=[0, 125],\n       ylim=[0, 400]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained in the last two graphs is exactly the same, but somehow this last graph looks much worse! Why is this so?\n\n\n\n\nBrutsaert, Wilfried. 2005. Hydrology: An Introduction. Cambridge University Press.",

    "text": "9.2 Thornthwaite\nSource: Ward and Trimble (2003), pages 107-108.\nThornthwaite (1948) developed an equation to predict monthly evapotranspiration from mean monthly temperature and latitude data (Equation 4.27). The small amount of data needed is attractive because often ET needs to be predicted for sites where few weather data are available. Based on what we know about ET, we should be skeptical about the general applicability of such a simple equation. Thornthwaite (1948) was not satisfied with the proposed approach: “The mathematical development is far from satisfactory. It is empirical. … The chief obstacle at present to the development of a rational equation is the lack of understanding of why potential ET corresponding to a given temperature is not the same everywhere.”\nTaylor and Ashcroft (1972), as cited in Skaggs (1980), provided insight into the answer to Thornthwaite’s ques- tion. They said:\n\nThis equation, being based entirely upon a temperature relationship, has the disadvantage of a rather flimsy phys- ical basis and has only weak theoretical justification. Since temperature and vapor pressure gradients are mod- ified by the movement of air and by the heating of the soil and surroundings, the formula is not generally valid, but must be tested empirically whenever the climate is appreciably different from areas in which it has been tested. … In spite of these shortcomings, the method has been widely used. Because it is based entirely on temper- ature data that are available in a large number of localities, it can be applied in situations where the basic data of the Penman method are not available.\n\nM.E. Jensen et al. (1990) warn that Thornthwaite’s method is generally only applicable to areas that have climates similar to that of the east central U.S., and it is not applicable to arid and semiarid regions.\nThornthwaite (1948) found that evapotranspiration could be predicted from an equation of the form\n\nE = 16\\left[ \\frac{10\\,T^\\text{monthly mean}}{I} \\right]^a,\n where \nI = \\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\left[ \\frac{T_i^\\text{monthly mean}}{5} \\right]^{1.514},\n and \n\\begin{split}\na =& +6.75\\times 10^{-7}I^3 \\\\\n   &- 7.71\\times 10^{-5}I^2 \\\\\n   &+ 1.792\\times 10^{-2}I \\\\\n   &+ 0.49239\n\\end{split}\n\n\nE is the monthly potential ET (mm)\nT_\\text{monthly mean} is the mean monthly temperature in °C\nI is a heat index\na is a location-dependent coefficient",

    "text": "9.3 Penman\nSources:\nBrutsaert (2005), pages 123-127.\nWard and Trimble (2003), subsections 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.5, 4.6.6.\nAllen et al. (1998), “Crop evapotranspiration - Guidelines for computing crop water requirements - FAO Irrigation and drainage paper 56”\nThe Penman model is almost entirely a theory-based formula for predicting evaporative flux. It can run on a much finer timescale, and requires a much wider variety of data than most models. In addition to temperature, the Penman functions on measurements of radiation, wind speed, elevation above sea level, vapor-pressure deficit, and heat flux density to the ground. The potential ET (in mm d^{-1}) is given by:\n\nE = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\left[ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta+\\gamma}Q_{ne}+ \\frac{\\gamma}{\\Delta+\\gamma}E_A \\right],\n\nwhere Q_n is the available energy flux density\n\nQ_n = R_n - G,\n\nand E_A is the drying power of the air\n\nE_A = 6.43\\cdot f(u)\\cdot\\text{VPD}.\n\nThe constituents of the equations above are\n\nE: potential evapotranspiration (mm d^{-1})\n\\Delta: slope of the saturation water vapor pressure curve (kPa °C^{-1})\n\\gamma: psychrometric constant (kPA °C^{-1})\n\\lambda: latent heat of vaporization (MJ kg^{-1})\nR_n: net radiation (MJ m^{-2} d^{-1})\nG: heat flux density to the ground (MJ m^{-2} d^{-1})\nf(u): wind function (dimensionless)\nVPD: vapor pressure deficit (kPa)\n\nand the number 6.43 adjusts the units of E_A so it is in MJ m^{-2} d^{-1}. In what follows, we will further discuss these constituents.\n\n9.3.1 Psychrometric Constant\nThe psychrometric constant \\gamma (kPA °C^{-1}) relates the partial pressure of water in air to the air temperature:\n\n\\begin{split}\n    \\gamma &= \\frac{c_p\\, P}{\\lambda\\cdot MW_\\text{ratio}} \\\\\n    P &= 101.3-0.01055 H \\\\\n    \\lambda &= 2.501 - 2.361\\times 10^{-3}\\,T\n\\end{split}\n\n\nMW_\\text{ratio}=0.622: ratio molecular weight of water vapor/dry air\nP: atmospheric pressure (kPa). Can be either measured or inferred from station height above sea level (m).\n\\lambda: latent heat of water vaporization (MJ kg^{-1})\nc_p=0.001013: specific heat capacity of moist air (MJ kg^{-1} °C^{-1})\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Net Radiation\nSource: Ward and Trimble (2003), page 99.\nR_n (MJ m^{-2} d^{-1}) is net radiation, the balance between net short wave R_s and the long wave R_b components of the radiation:\n\nR_n = (1-\\alpha)R_s\\!\\! \\downarrow -R_b \\!\\! \\uparrow,\n\nwhere \\alpha (dimensionless) is the albedo. The net outgoing thermal radiation R_b is given by\n\nR_b = \\left( a\\frac{R_s}{R_{so}+b} \\right)R_{bo},\n\nwhere R_{so} is the solar radiation on a cloudless day, and it depends on latitude and day of the year. R_{bo} is given by\n\nR_{bo} = \\epsilon\\, \\sigma\\, T^4_{Kelvin},\n\nwhere \\sigma=4.903\\times 10^{-9} MJ m^{-2} d^{-1} K^{-4}, and \\epsilon is net net emissivity:\n\n\\epsilon=-0.02+0.261 \\exp\\left(-7.77\\times10^{-4}T_{Celcius}^2\\right).\n\nThe parameters a and b are determined for the climate of the area:\n\na=1.0, b=0.0 for humid areas,\na=1.2, b=-0.2 for arid areas,\na=1.1, b=-0.1 for semihumid areas.\n\nWe can find below a table for R_{so}, from Ward and Trimble (2003), page 100. \n\n\n9.3.3 Heat Flux Density to the Ground\nThe heat flux density to the ground G (MJ m^{-2} d^{-1}) can be calculated using\n\n    G = 4.2\\frac{T_{i+1}-T_{i-1}}{\\Delta t},\n\nwhere \\Delta t is the time in days between midpoints of time periods i+1 and i−1, and T is the air temperature (°C).\nThis expression is really a finite differences implementation of a time derivative:\n\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\text{d}T}{\\text{d}t} = \\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{T(t+\\Delta t) - T(t-\\Delta t)}{2\\Delta t}.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.4 Vapor Pressure\nSource: Ward and Trimble (2003), page 95.\nThe Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD, in kPa) is the difference between saturation vapor pressure e_s and actual vapor pressure e_d:\n\n\\text{VPD} = e_s - e_d.\n\nFor temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 °C, the saturation vapor pressure can be calculated with\n\n    e_s = \\exp \\left[ \\frac{16.78\\, T -116.9}{T+237.3} \\right],\n\nand the actual vapor pressure is given by\n\n    e_d = e_s \\frac{RH}{100},\n\nwhere RH is the relative humidity (%), and the temperature T in the equations above is in degrees Celcius.\nWe can see below a graph of e_s(T)\n\n\n\nSource: Ward and Trimble (2003), page 96\n\n\nThe factor \\Delta is the slope of e_s(T). See the figure below from Brutsaert, where the saturation vapor pressure is called e^*):\n\n\n\nSource: Brutsaert (2005), page 28\n\n\nThere are a few ways of defining the function for \\Delta(T) (kPa °C^{-1}). Ward and Trimble (2003) give the following:\n\n    \\Delta = 0.200 \\cdot (0.00738\\,T + 0.8072)^7 - 0.000116,\n\nwhile differentiating the exponential expression given before yields:\n\n    \\Delta = \\frac{\\text{d} e_s}{\\text{d}T} = e_s(T)\\cdot \\frac{4098.79}{(T+237.3)^2}.\n\n\n\n9.3.5 Wind Function\nSource: Ward and Trimble (2003), page 108\n\n    f(u) = 0.26(1.0 + 0.54\\, u_2)",

    "text": "15.2 Rainfall-Runoff Models\n\n15.2.1 The Rational Method\nThe rational method postulates a simple proportionality between peak discharge, q_{pk}, and rainfall intensity, p^*:\n\nq_{pk} = \\varepsilon_R \\cdot C_R \\cdot A_D \\cdot p^*\n\n\nq_{pk}: peak discharge (m^3/s)\n\\varepsilon_R=0.278: unit-conversion factor\nC_R: dimensionless runoff coefficient\nA_D: drainage area (km^2)\np^*: rainfall intensity (mm/h)\n\n\nObviously the results obtained with the method are highly sensitive to the value chosen for CR; values range from 0.05 for gently sloping lawns up to 0.95 for highly urbanized areas of roofs and pavement.\nThe rational method is widely used in urban drainage design, but Pilgrim and Cordery (1992) caution that there are typically few data available to guide the selection of CR, and that CR for a given watershed may vary widely from storm to storm due to differing antecedent conditions.\n\n\n\n15.2.2 The Soil Conservation Service Curve-Number Method (SCS-CN)\nAlso called NRCS curve number procedure. NRCS = Natural Resources Conservation Service - USDA\n\nQ^* = P^* = \\frac{\\left( P-S_{I} \\right)^2}{P-S_I+S_{max}},\n\nwhere\n\nQ^*: total volume of event flow in a storm event\nP^*: total volume of effective water input in a storm event\nP: total volume of water input in a storm event\nS_{I}: initial abstraction = amount of rainfall that is retained or absorbed by the land surface before runoff occurs\nS_{max}: potential maximum retention = maximum amount of water that the watershed can retain after runoff starts\n\nThe initial abstraction S_I is usually approximated as 0.2\\cdot S_{max}, therefore:\n\nQ^* = P^* = \\frac{\\left( P-0.2\\cdot S_{max} \\right)^2}{P+0.8\\cdot S_{max}}\n\n\nS_{max} = 25.4\\left(\\frac{1000}{CN}-10\\right)\n\nThe number 25.4 is a conversion factor from inches to millimeters.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: United States Department of Agriculture (2004)\n\n\nThe curve number (CN) is a function of the ability of soils to infiltrate water, land use, and the soil water conditions at the start of a rainfall event (antecedent soil water condition). To account for the infiltration characteristics of soils, the NRCS has divided soils into four hydrologic soil groups, which are defined as follows (NRCS, 1984):\n\nGroup A (low runoff potential): Soils with high infiltration rates even when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of deep, well-drained sands and gravels. These soils have a high rate of water transmission (final infiltration rate greater than 0.3 in./h).\nGroup B: Soils with moderate infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of soils that are moderately deep to deep, moderately well drained to well drained with moderately fine to moderately coarse textures. These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission (final infil- tration rate 0.15 to 0.30 in./h).\nGroup C: Soils with slow infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of soils with a layer that impedes downward movement of water or soils with moderately fine to fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water transmission (final infiltration rate 0.05 to 0.15 in./h).\nGroup D (high runoff potential): Soils with very slow infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of clay soils with a high swelling potential, soils with a permanent high water table, soils with a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and shallow soils over nearly impervious materials. These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission (final infiltration rate less than 0.05 in./h).\n\nThere are also three categories for Antecedent Soil Moisture Condition (AMC):\n\nAMC I: Dormant season antecedent soil moisture less than 0.5 in. Growing season antecedent soil moisture less than 1.4 in.\nAMC II: Dormant season antecedent soil moisture between 0.5 and 1.1 in. Growing season anteced- ent soil moisture between 1.4 and 2.1 in.\nAMC III: Dormant season antecedent soil mois- ture greater than 1.1 in. Growing season anteced- ent soil moisture greater than 2.1 in.\n\nSee the table below to find curve numbers for AMC II: \n\nP=21\nratio = 4.17e4/2.61e5\nCN=86\nSmax = 25.4 * (1000/CN - 10)\nPmin = 0.2 * Smax\nQstar = 0.0\nif P &gt; Pmin:\n    Qstar = (P - 0.2*Smax)**2 / (P+0.8*Smax)\nQstar/P\n\n0.14270006393832066\n\n\n\nratio\n\n0.15977011494252874\n\n\n\nQstar / P\n\n0.9148811393863234\n\n\n\n%matplotlib notebook\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef Qstar_f(pe, CN):\n#     Smax = 25.4*(1000/CN - 10)\n    Smax = (1000/CN - 10)\n#     Smax = (1000/CN - 10) / 25.4\n    Qstar = (pe - 0.2*Smax)**2 / (pe+0.8*Smax)\n    return Qstar\n\npe = np.linspace(0,8,101)\n# plt.plot(pe, Qstar_f(pe, 35))\nplt.plot(pe, Qstar_f(pe, 50))\n# plt.plot(pe, Qstar_f(pe, 85))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDingman, S.

These watersheds are called water limited.\nIn wet watersheds, at the annual scale, the sensible heat (H) is directed from the surface to the atmosphere in almost all climatic zones on Earth (meaning: soil heats air). Therefore, H cannot supply much energy to the soil surface, and it is assumed that R_n provides entirely the energy required for evapotranspiration. Dividing the second equation by \\lambda_w, we get R_n/\\lambda_w = ET + H/\\lambda_w. It is clear that the maximum possible ET occurs when all incoming radiation energy R_n is consumed by evapotranspiration ET, and there is negligible sensible heat flux H. As a result, the upper limit of \\lambda_w E is R_n, in wet watersheds. In these watersheds, called energy limited, ET tends to the potential evapotranspiration (ET_0).\n\n16.4.1 Summary:\nFor energy-limited watersheds\n\n\nAs precipitation P\\rightarrow \\infty, evapotranspiration ET\\rightarrow ET_0\n\n\nFor water-limited watersheds\n\n\nAs potential evapotranspiration ET_0\\rightarrow \\infty, actual evaporation ET\\rightarrow P\n\n\nIn general, we can write\n\nET = f(P,ET_0)\n\nThe variables P and ET have the same dimenstions (L T^{-1}), and we can divide the equation above by P:\n\n\\frac{ET}{P} = f(D_I),\n\nwhere \nD_I = \\displaystyle\\frac{ET_0}{P}\n is called the dryness index. A useful classification is\n\n\n\nDryness Index\nClassification\n\n\n\n\nD_I &lt; 1.54\nHumid\n\n\n1.54 &lt; D_I &lt; 2\nDry Subhumid\n\n\n2 &lt; D_I &lt; 5\nSemi-arid\n\n\n5 &lt; D_I &lt; 20\nArid\n\n\n20 &lt; D_I\nHyper-arid\n\n\n\n\nATTENTION. The dryness index can also be called the “Aridity Index” (AI), however sometimes the AI means the inverse of D_I:\nAI = 1/D_I\nBe careful to check the definitions.\nThe summary (1) and (2) above can be now represented as:\n\n\nAs D_I\\rightarrow 0, \\displaystyle\\frac{ET}{P}\\rightarrow D_I\n\n\n\n\nAs D_I\\rightarrow \\infty, \\displaystyle\\frac{ET}{P}\\rightarrow 1\n\n\nBudyko (1974), proposed the following equation:\n\n\\frac{ET}{P} = \\left[ D_I \\tanh\\left( \\frac{1}{D_I} \\right)\\left( 1-e^{-D_I} \\right) \\right]^{1/2}\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Jones et al. (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Krajewski et al. (2021)\n\n\nThere are many alternatives to Budyko’s equation. Many equations have adjustable parameters, such as Fu’s equation:\n\n\\frac{ET}{P} = 1 + D_I - (1 + D_I^w)^{1/w},\n\nwhere w&gt;1. Each catchment has its own specific parameter w, that may represent biophysical/landscape features. There is no concensus regarding the interpretation of w, ranging from an effective empirical parameter, whose relationship to biophysical features can be discerned, to an arbitrary empirical constant with no a priori physical meaning.

    "text": "16.5 Hypotheses for why dryness index controls so much the partitioning of P into ET and Q\nSource: Berghuijs, Gnann, and Woods (2020)\n\nThe first is that the Budyko curve is accurate because landscape features (e.g., soils and vegetation) coevolve with the local climate in such a manner that precipitation partitioning into streamflow and evapotranspiration converges towards the Budyko curve\nA second hypothesis is that catchments over time evolve towards the supply and demand limits (rather than towards a curve), because landscapes and their vegetation are unaware of the Budyko curve but do evolve to maximize their use of available resources (including water). However, because limiting factors such as climatic variability exist (which will reduce a catchment’s ability to use all water because it cannot fully buffer the highly variable precipitation input), catchments will tend to not reach these limits. This may lead to an (apparent) existence of the Budyko curve which falls relatively close to the demand and supply limits.\nA third hypothesis is that the existence of a strong universal relationship between aridity and catchment water balances might be explained by an underlying organizing principle such as maximum entropy production because the Budyko curve may be consistent with how hydrologic systems optimally partition water and energy\nA fourth hypothesis is that virtually any landscape and climate combination (also those in heavily disturbed landscapes: e.g., a city, agricultural lands, etc.) will fall near the Budyko curve because climate aridity will dominate precipitation partitioning largely independent of the climate-landscape configuration or any optimization principle.",
