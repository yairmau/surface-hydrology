        "\n",
        "This is an introductory course in Surface Hydrology, dealing with some of the major processes in the hydrologic cycle: precipitation, evaporation and transpiration, infiltration, runoff generation and streamflow. The different topics will be treated using mathematical models and practical programming exercises.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Course aims\n",
        "\n",
        "The course aims at giving the students a quantitative understanding of the main processes in the hydrologic cycle. We will characterize the hydrologic cycle and its fluxes through mass balance equations. The random nature of the various processes will be studied with statistics, time series analysis, return periods, extreme value distributions, etc. We will take a “hands-on approach”, where students will actively engage with the material by analysing data and writing models using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Identify the various components of hydrologic budget and their interdependency. \n",
        "* Describe the various processes in hydrology (precipitation, infiltration, evaporation, etc) in a mathematical language. \n",
        "* Write computer code to analyze the statistics of hydrologic fluxes, and construct models of hydrological systems.\n",
